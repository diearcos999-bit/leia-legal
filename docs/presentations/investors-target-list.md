## Red Flags to Avoid

**Bad Investors** (even if they offer money):
- Taking >30% equity at seed
- Demanding board control at seed
- No clear thesis (just "spray and pray")
- Bad reputation in community (ask around!)
- Super slow decision making (>6 weeks)
- Want onerous terms (super-pro-rata, participating preferred, etc.)

**Questions to Ask Them**:
1. "What's your typical follow-on strategy?" (Want to see they reserve for Series A)
2. "Can I talk to 3 founders from your portfolio?" (Check references!)
3. "What's your decision timeline?" (Should be 2-4 weeks max)
4. "How do you typically add value post-investment?" (Specifics, not vague "network")
5. "What happens if we're not hitting milestones?" (Understand their reaction to adversity)

---

## Term Sheet Negotiation Points

**Key Terms to Focus On**:

1. **Valuation** (Pre-money vs Post-money)
   - Target: $1.6-2M pre-money, $2-2.4M post-money
   - Don't over-optimize here at seed

2. **Liquidation Preference**
   - Accept: 1x non-participating
   - Avoid: Participating preferred, >1x multiple

3. **Board Composition**
   - Seed: 1 investor, 2 founders = 3 person board OK
   - Avoid: Investor control at seed

4. **Pro-Rata Rights**
   - Expect: Full pro-rata + 50-100% super-pro-rata
   - This is standard and good

5. **Vesting**
   - Accept: 4-year vest, 1-year cliff for founders
   - Standard, protects everyone

6. **Option Pool**
   - Negotiate: 10-15% pool POST-money (not pre!)
   - Material difference in dilution

**Things to Push Back On**:
- Redemption rights
- Excessive drag-along rights
- Founder vesting acceleration (keep it)
- No-shop too long (2-4 weeks OK, not 8 weeks)

**Get Legal Help**:
- Use lawyer experienced in VC deals
- Cost: $5-10K for term sheet review + closing
- Worth every peso

---

## Resources

**Communities**:
- AngelList Chile
- Meetup: "Santiago Startups"
- Founder Institute Chile (alumni network)
- Endeavor Chile (when bigger)

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Complete this list with specific contact info
2. **Week 2**: Craft personalized emails for top 10 targets
3. **Week 3**: Start reaching out (intros first, then cold)
4. **Week 4**: Book first meetings
5. **Week 6-8**: Second meetings + due diligence
6. **Week 10-12**: Term sheets + closing

**Goal**: Ronda cerrada en 3 meses max.

**Mantras**:
- "Fundraising is a numbers game" - Talk to many, close best fit
- "Fundraise when you don't need it" - Position of strength
- "Investors invest in momentum" - Show traction, even if small
- "Get back to building ASAP" - Fundraising is distraction from actual work

**Buena suerte! 🚀**
